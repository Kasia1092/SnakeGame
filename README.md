# Snake Game with SFML

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) in C++. The game provides a basic interface where the player controls a snake that grows in length as it eats food, with the objective being to survive as long as possible without colliding with the walls or itself.

For using this program you need to install and connect SFML library.
